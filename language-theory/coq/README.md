# Language Theory and Verification Using Coq

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of lab work and exercises focused on language theory and its applications in the context of verification, using the Coq proof assistant. The projects and exercises here explore fundamental concepts of formal languages, automata theory, and formal verification.

## About Coq
Coq is an interactive theorem prover and proof assistant, used for writing formal proofs. By expressing algorithms and properties in Coq's functional language, users can develop a deeper understanding of these concepts and ensure their correctness through formal verification.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into separate folders for each lab work module, encompassing various topics in language theory and verification.

### Folders:
- `Lab1/`: Introduction to basic concepts in language theory.
- `Lab2/`: Exploring automata and their applications in language recognition.
- `Lab3/`: Advanced topics in language theory and formal verification.
- `...`: Additional lab modules and exercises.

Each folder contains:
- Coq source files (`.v` files) with exercises and solutions.
- Supplementary materials and notes.

## Getting Started
To work with these exercises, you will need to have Coq installed on your system. You can download and install Coq from [Coq's official website](https://coq.inria.fr/).

### Installation:
- Follow the installation guide on the website to set up Coq.
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to each lab folder and open the `.v` files with CoqIDE or your preferred Coq environment.

## Usage
- Each lab folder contains a series of exercises represented in Coq files.
- You can interactively work through these exercises in CoqIDE.
- Use the provided notes and comments within the files for guidance.
